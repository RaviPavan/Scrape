Working on his team was the most enjoyable period of time I've had in the corporate world. Everyone on his team that he managed genuinely liked and respected him.

He's a winner, and any company would be lucky to have him on their team.‚Äù","Sara Saard ‚ÄúJason must be the smartest salesperson I have known. Watching him overcoming objections the way fighter dodging rolls of punches was indeed intriquing. He takes the delicate art of sales to the highest level. Even with my 14 years sales experience, I suddenly felt like a young-ling watching Yoda in a battle. True asset to a team.‚Äù","Kevin Hart ‚ÄúJason has counseled me and my company on numerous occasions. His insights into search marketing deliver tremendous value and his genuine caring about positive outcomes is inspiring. My business is stronger by having him in its corner.‚Äù","Kirk Douglas ‚ÄúJason was a joy to work with and one of the most supportive person's I've ever known.

I stay in touch with Jason and would not hesitate to call on him again when looking for expert online marketing services consultation.‚Äù","Blair Vincent ‚ÄúJason is a real go-getter. He is a dedicated sales person with an amazing attitude and spirit. He excels at developing relationships and finding ways to persevere when others have already given up. Jason is focused and determined, always exceeding sales quotas and goals. He is an extremely valuable asset to our organization.‚Äù","Bill W. ‚ÄúWhat I liked best about working with Jason was his easy going, no pressure approach.

As a professional, I have worked with some of the well known startups of India like Housing.com, Zeta and many other big and small names around the world. I presently oversee Consumer Design at Swiggy, India‚Äôs largest food ordering and delivery platform. Also, I have delivered 50+ UX talks / workshop at various places including big names like Amazon, Grab, Shopee, Practo, IDC IIT Bombay, IIT Guwahati, NID Bangalore etc. When I am not designing, I am either drafting my next design talk, or travelling in some far off country. If you think I sound interesting, drop me a message. We can catch up over a cup of coffee :)","city":"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India","followers":"64","connections":"500","educations_details":"Indian Institute of Technology, Madras","posts":[{"title":"How I designed the listing for a brand new Food App - Swiggy Daily","attribution":"By Saptarshi Prakash","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQEDQU9R0qmRbA/article-cover_image-shrink_180_320/0/1583083168421?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ZdffKkgbd3uiqp_F2BPdaH_zMKRHQQt_uHc3Dsft8GQ","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-designed-listing-brand-new-food-app-swiggy-daily-prakash?trk=public_profile_article_view","created_at":"2020-03-16T00:00:00.000Z"},{"title":"How I became an Illustrator by discovering a new dimension","attribution":"By Saptarshi Prakash","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQFVC5baRpMz1A/article-cover_image-shrink_180_320/0/1566029228531?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=u6a2NeEeEIXVBLjuB5WlkASEqeEVZRZ_cvkOSHKA6BM","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-became-illustrator-discovering-new-dimension-saptarshi-prakash?trk=public_profile_article_view","created_at":"2019-08-19T00:00:00.000Z"},{"title":"How I started Motion Design using high-school Physics","attribution":"By Saptarshi Prakash","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5112AQF26ttSuTo2Dw/article-cover_image-shrink_180_320/0/1552978447736?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=6VRttktsbPmnV9tMy5soGk9qaj_EiOfRaRf9pcXqCGE","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-started-motion-design-using-high-school-physics-prakash?trk=public_profile_article_view","created_at":"2019-03-19T00:00:00.000Z"}],"education":[{"title":"Indian Institute of Technology, Madras","degree":"Dual Degree - BTech, MTech","field":"Electrical, Electronics and Communications Engineering","meta":"2009 - 2014 Activities and Societies: Shaastra, Saarang, Mitr, Design Club, Electrical Engineering Association, CTides","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/reachiitm/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click","end_year":"2014"},{"title":"FIITJEE","degree":"Junior High/Intermediate/Middle School Education and Teaching","meta":"2006 - 2009","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/fiitjee-iit/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click","end_year":"2009"}],"certifications":[{"title":"Barefoot Behavioral Counselor","subtitle":"Medall","meta":"Issued Mar 2013"}],"courses":[],"languages":["[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]"],"groups":[],"people_also_viewed":[{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/abhisek93?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/akshata-chandra?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/jaisheel-nishad-a823101b?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/bikironbora24?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/amritag?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/gowtham-magesh?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/athul-athreya-42614742?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/lovish10?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/adeshbhansali?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/realvaibhava?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/anudeep108?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/arpitvrm?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/sidharthanvp?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/qalamkaari-garima?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/realvjy?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/nitishkmrk?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/mayankk98?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/antivirusakash?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/charu-choudha?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirudh-palaskar?trk=public_profile_browsemap"}],"activities":[{"title":"I've participated in the 2-day UI webinar workshop conducted by GrowthSchool and hosted by Saptarshi Prakash.

He is rigorous, opinionated, and pays plenty of attention to detail. In specific, his motion design portfolio is outstanding, and frequently pushes the envelope with what he tries to achieve with Adobe After Effects. I worked with him closely as a Frontend Developer at Housing.com, and frequently blew me away with the designs he came up with, in spite of the already high bar set by Housing designers. I'd recommend him to anyone!‚Äù","Nandita Vadali ‚ÄúI have worked with Saptarshi as a Core Group Member at Mitr, IIT Madras. He is a very efficient and proactive team leader. He has taken the initiative to help several students in serious problems in the campus, at any time of the day. His design skills and website management skills were a huge asset to the team. He incorporated a new documentation system (based on ISO 9001:2008 standards), towards certification for the group's activities. He also introduced and actively organized several new events like Emoticon 360 fest with several competitions for the students, flash mob in IIT Madras, interactive mock quiz for freshers and many inspiring talks.

The result is someone who can solution creatively like a startup, ensure it is applicable universally given his experience working across the US/APAC and deliver it pushing the boundaries of speed and agility at a Bank. Working closely with Milind over the last year I have had the pleasure of seeing that all happen in parallel as he was instrumental in OCBC's ground breaking work with Google Pay in Singapore . I have also seen someone who inspires and leads his team by channelling the art of the possible. Those of us who have worked in banking know how much of a team sport this is and Milind is always making sure he takes everyone with him from legal to marketing and especially technology. He does this with his signature jovial disposition and humour which makes the journey that much more fun. It's been a pleasure working with Milind and I am excited to continue working with him to bring easy, intuitive and helpful solutions to consumers around the region.‚Äù","Prasoon Kumar ‚ÄúMilind has been actively mentoring billionBricks for over a year.

My passion lies in bolstering the software product/saas eco-system of India. I done my bit to build the Indian product eco-system in the last 15 years. Having played an active role at NASSCOM in starting the Product/Emerge movement, I continued my mission at iSPIRT. I built the much-revered iSPIRT programs like #SaaSx, #PNgrowth, #PNcamp, #PlaybookRT and run the #ProductNation blog and the latest is to drive the SaaS eco-system in India via SaaSBOOMi.com. I also lead the Community Initiatives at Accel in India and part of the team which drives #SeedToScale. I would like to think of myself as a connector, and since I have been in the ecosystem for a long time, I know many smart people who will benefit by being introduced to other smart people. Being able to do that makes me happy and I do it without expecting anything in return. I love my work as it first and foremost about people and relationships, and it is because of these deep friendships that I have been able to learn and grow. Some of the initiatives that I want to drive are the Product Thinking Mindset, an Open Source movement among many other ideas that revolve around transforming India into a Product Nation.

He was a solid technical recruiter and familiar enough with the job requirements for various open positions at Rackspace to find the best match for my skills at Rackspace. Unlike others that I knew that had to interview for multiple positions (since the pairing between skills and job requirements was as aptly matched), I only interviewed for the one position. Later, I was promoted into a hiring position and Bryan was promoted to Director. We've worked together since then while he's helped me build out my team at Rackspace. Bryan was able to build a solid technical recruiting team under him which in turn allowed me to grow my team from 10 developers up to 22 developers over the course of 18 months. Many of Bryan's technical recruiters were fairly \"green\" and I know they were able to succeed with Bryan's mentoring and guidance.

Izzy built and mentored the talent team at Entrepreneur First from scratch, growing the team from 2 to 8 over 3 months. As a highly-vested manager who cares a great deal for her team members, Izzy was highly meticulous in onboarding me, and offered excellent feedback during my first recruiting conversations. Her enthusiasm for leveraging on my strengths was contagious and motivated me, whilst being constructive over areas for improvement. Even when experiments failed, she was encouraging and supportive, rallying the entire team behind to identify how we can improve the recruitment processes. In addition to her inspirational managerial capabilities, Izzy is a superb closer. Her ability to read people, connect with them and understand their point of view is phenomenal -- that the team surpassed our targets of 100 offers made for EFSG3 bears testament to her knack for connecting well with professionals from diverse backgrounds and make them feel at ease quickly. I would relish the opportunity to work with Izzy again in future, and she's definitely a force to reckon with!‚Äù","Vincent Tan ‚ÄúIzzy was an outstanding mentor during my internship at Entrepreneur First. Even though I was new to the field of technical recruiting and sourcing, Izzy guided me perfectly such that I was sourcing the most talented individuals in Singapore on my own within a week, a testament to her knowledge on sourcing effectively as well as the Singapore talent landscape. As a manager, Izzy constantly made sure that effective communication was the top priority, which helped shaped proper goal setting and progress tracking. The most impressive skill of Izzy's was her ability to inspire people to apply for the EF programme - these computer scientists and engineers, most with PhDs and incredible accomplishments, had never heard of EF before, but after a mere 45 minute conversation with Izzy, I saw many of them seriously contemplating leaving their jobs to join the EF programme. Having talked to many of the founders that have completed the programme, it is clear that most of their journeys started solely because of the impact of Izzy's initial meeting. I believe this is because Izzy is able to relate extremely well to the people she speaks to and at the same time display a genuine appreciation for the talent that they have. I can proudly say that most of the skills and knowledge I gained from my internship can be attributed to Izzy, who was a great leader, mentor and colleague. I look forward to working with her again. ‚Äù"],"recommendations_count":"7","volunteer_experience":[],"projects":[],"patents":[],"publications":[],"awards":[],"experience":[null,null,{"title":"HR & Operations Manager","subtitle":"The Parent Inc.","subtitleURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/theparentinc?trk=public_profile_experience-item_profile-section-card_subtitle-click","location":"Singapore","description":"Southeast Asia‚Äôs top digital content and community platform, publishing theAsianparent.com, Kidlander.com and Pregnant.sg, reaching over 6 million readers every month.

From his amazing work devising and developing Manta (Joyent's distributed object store with integrated compute) to tracing through and debugging live code during issues in production, it all appears almost effortless for Mark! While working through software issues, Mark would not only explain a problem clearly and concisely, but also similarly explain actions he was taking to review and address a problem, in turn helping to direct others. Good enough isn't where things stop for him, it is the starting line for where things can be improved (much to the appreciation of my operations team). His open, honest nature serves him well both as an engineer and to the teams / organizations he leads. It is a pleasure to work with someone as capable, ambitious, prudent, and thoughtful as Mark.

Kim ‚ÄúI have had a great joy of co-designing and -teaching with Rahul on topics such as Leading Change for Organizational Renewal, and Developing Strategic Foresight to a large number of decision makers and leading thinkers across Asia, ranging from the government and politics, to corporate and community development. These engagements have supported senior leaders in thinking deeply and broadly about their responsibilities to their respective communities by mastering the adaptive and futurist mindsets and mechanisms of ethical and effective leadership. In this capacity, I was able to witness Rahul‚Äôs display of his outstanding teaching and coaching skills using various pedagogical methods widely used at Harvard, adding to this value with his great wealth of knowledge and experience in various sectors from policy formulation and strategy consulting to start-ups, and human capital development. In my capacity as the Founding President of the Center for Asia Leadership, which runs about seventy programs and events annually, I am also delighted that we are able to engage Rahul as the Country Head of Singapore. Rahul has exceeded far beyond this role by helping the Center enhance its capacity to more effectively advance its commitment and contributions towards social good through his coaching, teaching and support.‚Äù","Gregory Foo ‚ÄúRahul and I worked together for several years. Always ready to jump in with a constructive comment or idea when there seems to be no way forward, Rahul has been a particularly effective pathfinder, helping to get things 'unstuck' when there are intractable issues. Open and approachable, he sees the value of investing in others, building others up by sharing actively his experience in futures and foresight methods. I remember him as someone who gave strong guidance to the futures team as its advisor when we sought to break new ground in scenario planning and writing. Constantly looking out for ways to improve himself, Rahul seeks feedback about his own work performance when appropriate to do so, and making adjustments where needed. Many talk about the importance of having a 'growth mindset', Rahul lives it out! ‚Äù"],"recommendations_count":"3","volunteer_experience":["[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]"],"projects":[],"patents":[],"publications":["[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]"],"awards":["[object Object]"],"experience":[null,{"title":"Country Advisor and Faculty","subtitle":"Center for Asia Leadership","subtitleURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/center-for-asia-leadership-initiatives?trk=public_profile_experience-item_profile-section-card_subtitle-click","description":"Rahul is the Singapore country advisor for the Center for Asia Leadership, and teaches Adaptive Leadership across South-East Asia, including workshops in Singapore, Malaysia, Bangladesh and the Philippines.

On the other hand, developers write their applications the same way they would for HTTP. Whenever a no-internet connectivity scenario is encountered, UTP automatically kicks in and the app continues to function seamlessly.

He has worn many hats during that time, but one of his biggest contributions has been making us the go-to place for top talent from all over the world and the implementation of innovative hiring methods. His efforts have allowed us to grow from less than 10 people to an internationally distributed company of well over 750 people. He is an inspirational leader for Talent functions and the strength of his team represents the quality of people that want to work with and learn from him. ‚Äù","Andy King ‚ÄúI joined Improbable to work in the Talent team for Aaron. At the time we were around 20 people, no processes, interview structure or systems to manage recruitment. Aaron has managed to turn the Talent function into a smooth running machine that has allowed the company to grow to the Global business it is today. Aaron has ensured that by allowing Improbable the access to the Talent that was needed the business was able to develop the complex product we need to be successful. I may have moved away from recruitment but in my new role running the Global Mobility function, I still worked closely with Aaron. In this position, it gave me a deeper appreciation of Aaron's role and how he helped the company grow. Aaron sets a very high standard and will always push back on anything that does not meet those standards but this is needed if a business is to be able to grow in such an aggressive and successful way. From 20 people to over 800 with offices in three continents is an achievement to be proud of.‚Äù"],"recommendations_count":"40","volunteer_experience":[],"projects":[],"patents":[],"publications":["[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]"],"awards":[],"experience":[{"title":"VP Talent","subtitle":"Kraken Digital Asset Exchange","subtitleURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/krakenfx?trk=public_profile_experience-item_profile-section-card_subtitle-click","description":"Currently building a modern talent ecosystem fit for hyper-scale.

In Dec 2021, we raised one of the LARGEST SEED ever in the area from a top Bay Area Venture firm partner (Thank you for putting your belief in us) to realize our mission. We have a 3+ years of runway, which is extremely rare for a company at the seed stage. Why this raise? When we set out to build Revefi with the mission to transform the space of business data observability, we laid our requirements on 3 facets to put us on path for building a long lasting company. (1) People, culture - a super positive company that everyone wants to be part of (2) Technical prowess, solid Engineering principles - a place to learn from others, helping others grow (3) Finance - Last but not the least, when we are building something so substantive, a strong runway is imperative to provide our team the means and piece of mind to iterate, and build things the right way. We currently already have a distributed team, with offices in place in both Washington and California! With our foundational team including industry technical leaders (20+ years of Engineering and Product building excellence spanning companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft etc.), we are now looking for doers who are driven to learn, to make a difference and be a core part of such an experience to join us on our journey. Interested? Drop me a note and we can talk about our DNA - technical, engineering, data space, our culture. We are looking for zero to one doers, company builders across all disciplines - engineering, product, design to join us! If you thrive in ambiguities, are driven to solve customer problems, and want to get into the weeds of and shape how startups get built on top of building an awesome product itself from scratch, talk to us! Key Experiences: Organizational Leadership 1. Company building - Ex-cofounder of ThoughtSpot a ~4.2B company unicorn in Business Analytics. 2. Started company's Seattle office - Moved to Seattle from CA to start the first Engineering office of TS outside Bay Area at the time. Technical Leadership Drove two key technological areas and underlying stack that differentiated ThoughtSpot's core mission of analytics for all. a) Falcon - Love to discuss WHY we decided and then built a unique in-memory distributed database that ran on 100+ machines to enable company's core mission of search over data warehouse scale, and WHAT/HOW to realize this at such scale b) SpotIQ - HOW to bring the power of PUSH based analytics to complement search, other PULL models to the world of analytics","city":"Sammamish, Washington, United States","followers":"5","connections":"500","educations_details":"University of Wisconsin, Madison","posts":[],"education":[{"title":"University of Wisconsin, Madison","degree":"Masters","field":"Computer Science","meta":"1997 - 1998 Masters CS.","end_year":"1998"},{"title":"Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur","degree":"Bachelor's Degree","field":"Computer Science and Engineering","meta":"1993 - 1997 Bachelors CS","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/indian-institute-of-technology-kanpur/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_full-click","end_year":"1997"}],"certifications":[],"courses":[],"languages":["[object Object]","[object Object]"],"groups":[],"people_also_viewed":[{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/guptashashank?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pramod-kalipatnapu?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaushikraj?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yichao-zhao?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinsu2008?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kishore-shimikeri-3a99a659?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://in.linkedin.com/in/sandeep-kumar-0bb6011a?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gurudev?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpandey?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yinghai83?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahimulhaq?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikebelshe?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gertd?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtordable?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bartrobertson?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-calder-b964537?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/parveen-patel-b081622?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayushparashar?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/surbs?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shikhar-gulukul?trk=public_profile_browsemap"}],"activities":[{"title":"I mention impressive usage of ThoughtSpot that can be achieved.

Sanjay played an instrumental role in building the primary and most differentiated product offerings, hiring the engineering team, and acquiring and growing customers. The primary differentiation for ThoughtSpot in the first 5-6 years was interactive search, with the interactivity enabled by a fast homegrown MPP relational database. Sanjay drove its design through novel ideas around in-memory processing, JIT compilation, fast scalable ingest, distributed fault-tolerant architecture, and BI centric query optimization. The second wave of ThoughtSpot product innovation (AI driven insights, aka SpotIQ) was also led by Sanjay. In all Sanjay has the uncanny ability to take on high risk problems and through excellent exploration and execution, de-risk and deliver them. Besides Engineering leadership, Sanjay has an astute mind for product thinking and UX design. He is often involved end to end from product, UX design, Eng, and customer success for initiatives he owns. This ability to intricately connect a real use case to product building and ownership to ultimately drive user adoption in that use case is truly special in Sanjay. Sanjay is also not a person who would just \"go with the flow\" during ideation sessions. He maintains an independent point of view, even if unpopular, and will routinely challenge the status quo, making for highly effective brainstorming and design thinking sessions. Sanjay also played a pivotal role in building our engineering org globally. He hired several highly capable leaders and engineers across multiple global offices. Post hiring, he always remained closely involved to remove blockers and ensure their success. Sanjay is an outstanding leader who is great with product, customers, and people. He's personally been a valuable mentor to me and so many others.

He's never one to shy away from a challenge - in fact I think this is where he most thrives as he gets to use his creative talents to problem solve. He is also an accomplished public speaker and presenter. I've closely followed Anthony's journey as he has risen the ranks at Xero, first in Asia and now in North America and along the way he has continued to grow professionally and personally. He is incredibly intelligent but also humble and a great mentor and coach for his team - he will always go out of his way to help his team in any way he can.‚Äù"],"recommendations_count":"15","volunteer_experience":[],"projects":["[object Object]"],"patents":[],"publications":[],"awards":[],"experience":[null,{"title":"Accountant","subtitle":"Brentnalls SA","subtitleURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/brentnalls-sa?trk=public_profile_experience-item_profile-section-card_subtitle-click","location":"Adelaide, Australia","description":"‚Ä¢Compliance work (preparation of various tax returns, preparation of financial statements, reconciliation) ‚Ä¢Cashflow & Budget Analysis ‚Ä¢Management Reports ‚Ä¢Accounting Software integration ‚Ä¢Process & Policy change and implementation ‚Ä¢Participation in meetings, staff training and development programs and performance appraisals ‚Ä¢Compliance work (preparation of various tax returns, preparation of financial statements, reconciliation) ‚Ä¢Cashflow & Budget Analysis ‚Ä¢Management Reports ‚Ä¢Accounting Software integration ‚Ä¢Process & Policy change and implementation ‚Ä¢Participation in meetings, staff training and development programs and performance appraisals","duration":"Sep 2011 Jul 2014 2 years 11 months","start_date":"Sep 2011","duration_short":"2 years 11 months","end_date":"Jul 2014"},{"title":"Founder","subtitle":"NightLive","subtitleURL":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/nightlive?trk=public_profile_experience-item_profile-section-card_subtitle-click","description":"Founded in 2012 NightLive aims to change the way we interact on a night out.

Ido facilitated much of our product delivery planning, especially where coordination was needed across multiple teams (engineering, support, product marketing, customer success).

After she took the lead, the business went from relatively flat to doubling every two years. She did this by setting an aggressive strategic plan, organizing and staffing behind it, and driving all aspects of the business. Talented, driven, and curious, Eman is as strong a business leader as I've ever worked with.‚Äù","Beth Godlin ‚ÄúEman did a great job this year creating a culture of openness and collaboration while managing a great deal of underlying complexity.

My current line of work is all about people. I love being a part of making the workplace a better environment for the ones who spend the bulk of their waking hours here. This comes in the form of hiring great individuals. Individuals who positively impact people and culture, who truly care deeply about the work they do, and the teams they work with. Businesses are made up of its people. My passion to constantly challenge limits and grow through experiences probably came from learning the discipline of Karate from a young age of 8. Taking part in countless tournaments over the years lands me at 30 medals, a black belt, but more importantly has taught me to constantly improve, grow and seek to be better. I was privileged to also have been a recipient of the 2015 National Human Resource Scholarship by the Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM). When I'm not doing the above, I find peace in the unknown; trekking through uncharted trails and exploring foreign lands.","city":"Singapore","followers":"988","connections":"500","educations_details":"Nanyang Technological University","posts":[],"education":[{"title":"Nanyang Technological University","degree":"Bachelor of Business","field":"Human Resource Consulting (HRC) Specialization","meta":"2014 - 2017","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/ntusg/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click","end_year":"2017"},{"title":"Maastricht University School of Business and Economics","degree":"Business/Commerce, General","meta":"2016 - 2016 6 months Student Exchange","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/maastricht-university-school-of-business-and-economics/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click","end_year":"2016"},{"title":"Ngee Ann Polytechnic","degree":"Business Studies (Human Capital Management)","meta":"2011 - 2014 Activities and Societies: Ngee Ann Poly Shitoryu Karate Club (President), Ngee Ann Poly Badminton Team","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/ngee-ann-polytechnic/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click","end_year":"2014"},{"title":"Fuhua Secondary School","degree":"GCE O Levels","meta":"Activities and Societies: Badminton School Team (Vice-Captain)"}],"certifications":[{"title":"Karate Recognition of Dan Grade (Black Belt)","subtitle":"Shinwa-Kai Karate Club","meta":"Issued Mar 2007"}],"courses":[{"title":"Delivering, Receiving, & Asking for Feedback","subtitle":"-"},{"title":"Human Dimensions of Business","subtitle":"-"},{"title":"Negotiations","subtitle":"-"},{"title":"Unconscious Bias","subtitle":"-"},{"title":"MyHR Training","subtitle":"-"}],"languages":["[object Object]","[object Object]"],"groups":[],"people_also_viewed":[{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/sereneyapjj?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/nicoleinezsho?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/yilin-chiam-aa376886?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/mendozaisabelle?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/sharon-lim-774a84a2?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/zulaikha-afandi?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/nicholasstripe?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/kaylietannia?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/joyxu?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/joanna-lo-?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/vandana-choudhary-31935b71?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/ariellimaz?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/ebellam?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/dnle?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/lautiffany?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/kimberly-yip-2907?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/phoebe-jonzen-2a163745?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/hinamran?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/nikki-heng?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/liyana-razi?trk=public_profile_browsemap"}],"activities":[{"title":"I enjoyed being part of this panel, discussing the future of payments at the annual AusPayNet 2022 Summit today.

I enjoy building businesses and new functions ground up, particularly in emerging markets. I have a proven track record in Sales & Business Development, Product Management, P&L Management and Cross-Geography Team Management. My experience spans multiple geographies - Asia-Pacific markets like S.E. Asia, Australia, India, Korea, Japan and Greater China as well as the United States - specifically around driving partnerships, client development, building products, managing regulatory engagements and scaling operations. I believe that great people and motivated teams are the key to success and have been lucky enough to lead several talented teams through my career. I am regularly invited to present and moderate discussions at leadership meetings, offsite sessions and industry events. Forums I have spoken or presented at include the Global Fintech Festival, SG Fintech Festival, SG Fintech Association, Women in Payments, Interserkt Australia, Fintech New Zealand, Money 2020, American Chamber of Commerce, the Rotary Club of Singapore, the Entrepreneurs Organization Asia and the Human Capital Leadership Institute. I've also evaluated, mentored & advised start ups, most recently as part of the MAS Fintech Awards, Global FinTech Hackcelerator (organized by the Monetary Authority of Singapore) and previously the FinLab Challenge (organized by the UNCDF, Bank Negara Malaysia & Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation). I am passionate about diversity & inclusion issues in the workplace. Most recently I served as a Mentor for the Led By Foundation, a leadership program for the development of young Indian Muslim women. In 2019, I was selected as a Rise Up 'Power Player' honoring the Top 30 Women in Payments in Asia. I am currently a Grassroots Leader for the People‚Äôs Association of Singapore (Balmoral Neighborhood Committee).","city":"Singapore","followers":"7","connections":"500","educations_details":"Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad","posts":[],"education":[{"title":"Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad","degree":"MBA","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/iimahmedabad/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click"},{"title":"National Institute of Technology Calicut","degree":"B.Tech","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/national-institute-of-technology-calicut/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click"},{"title":"Chinmaya Vidyalaya","degree":"CBSE"},{"title":"Northwestern University","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/northwestern-university/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click"},{"title":"University of Pennsylvania - The Wharton School","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/school/the-wharton-school/?trk=public_profile_school_profile-section-card_image-click"}],"certifications":[],"courses":[],"languages":["[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]","[object Object]"],"groups":[],"people_also_viewed":[{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/isabel-kong-558111154?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/fannie?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/szomoraa?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikestepanovich?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/maaikedoyer?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://il.linkedin.com/in/keikonavon?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/paulinesim?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://il.linkedin.com/in/ying-wang-245b9931?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/poojyatakhattar?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/zutshi?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/mayank-dutt-75a7333?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/fnandes?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://id.linkedin.com/in/fauzanhamdi?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/cecilia-tan-%E9%99%88%E5%A7%BF%E6%BD%93-b223a812?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/antonbelousov?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/charuj?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/nicosalaniomba?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/shihshen?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/emre-durusut?trk=public_profile_browsemap"},{"profile_link":"https://sg.linkedin.com/in/anilmathur?trk=public_profile_browsemap"}],"activities":[{"title":"Full house for our Riskified Big Ideas Session here at #nrf2023!","attribution":"Liked by Tasneen Padiath","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQF81YRhcthdzg/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1673795868679?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Xhqkfhy5awm69kF7a2uDFzZ-QpPgJRHb9jsAsIxhAlE","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tavarjames_nrf2023-activity-7020408709822480384-oADO"},{"title":"Found this moving","attribution":"Liked by Tasneen Padiath","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E22AQGMOLhSWjPsNA/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1672668895703?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=pEfquZgUScEcL7FwB4YVpi0UlsO8wsoCRMIg9yiFJZU","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/profgalloway_found-this-moving-activity-7015681844410998784-GsdG"},{"title":"On Tuesday night, Michelle Yeoh won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture in a Musical or Comedy, and during her speech she was‚Ä¶","attribution":"Liked by Tasneen Padiath","img":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/C4E27AQEtJoaTZ6wfhg/articleshare-shrink_800/0/1673840892729?e=1674450000&v=beta&t=1DNk1AmBNep0I7Wj74R4_lZ9ATptRqP5ZeV4hLtjXCk","link":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/davelu_why-michelle-yeohs-shut-up-at-the-golden-activity-7019455704071553024-XaEf"}],"recommendations":["Maggie Valliant Fern√°ndez ‚ÄúTasneen is a wonderful colleague and professional.
